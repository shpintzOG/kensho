        Well to start basically building out a website for my friends. Hopefully it will work out. Need to finish building out the layout and a few extra features. Want to be able to create a few sections as well and basically link it all up together. Eventually might see what would be better to handle blogs as well as updates since I will eventually be adding in updates regularly. Since this is not really a basic blog site I am trying to figure out what will be the best case cenerio for something like this.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyways what I am trying to get to is basically what the site is going to be about. What will it focus on and what to except from it. This is going to be something big but also small and cool. I dont want to go too full out on in and rather make extention sites but I just want to also create a cool basic foundation as well. Kind of just trying to figure out how I am going to do that. Might create a raspberry pi that will be hosting a server to host the site but again kind of a noob to all this so hopefully things will make more sense next week or the following days.
      </p>

      <p>
        Basically this is going to be a small introduction site to what is to come. As well a little way to show tribute to my friends so they know I dont stop thinking about them and just working on something that can get us back into the sprit of things. Something to get me out of my bag but at the same time just something that will be pretty cool to build.
      </p>

      <p>
        This year is going to be a big year and kind of just wanna be prepared for it. Going to be setting up a discord server as well as telegram and IRC chat too just to be able to communicate better. At the same time might build my own little message center just because. But just want to do this to set up the communicate stream. This year big things are to happen and I want to get on top of it. From coding, to bulding, to hacking. There are a lot of resources to use and hopefully we will get through it all by the end of the year with some projects completed and money made and knowledge gained at the end of the year.
      </p>

      <p>
        I will be creating a note book / course that will be covering the basics of setting up your computer to start coding to using github and then learning web development and coding a few applications. Going to be doing this with
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>HTML + CSS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>Rust</li>
        <li>Solidity</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Typescript</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Yeah this are a few programing languages that I feel like are going to be very useful in this upcoming year. From building web applications, to building dApps to running software. We are going to need to know these languages to eventually building some <strong>Top Secret</strong> very soon.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time want to build out a code editor to use as well as just show how to do that, as well as create our own little CSS styling tool too. There are a few out there already but we are going to be building our own tools as well. Just keep it noted there will be a github link as well as in discord and other communicate parts that I will provide
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time I want us to build a few projects too. These will be basic to be able to get the funamentals of web development secured. That we can use the web browser to build tools. As well as make preety websites too hahaha. Well thats just from what I had learned. This is going to be somewhat built quickly so if you guys have any problems do make some commits on on github or send me a message to fix.
      </p>

      <p>
        After we build 3 sites that are like tools and 3 sites that are themed and 2 sites that use API 2 sites that use a database, 2 sites that are Blog themed 2 sites that are form themes and 2 sites that are shopify themed. We are basically good with the tech, have some projects, and templets ready for anything. Seems like a lot but totally worth the journey
      </p>

      <p>
        We can then start moving into solidity as soon as possible. This is going to be where we are going to be building on the etherum block chain and nervos network. We are going to need to understand how the blockchain works and basically understand what a smart contract is. It will be easy but difficult because building a smart contract needs some brain power to configure. Its easy but creating one needs to be kind of planned out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then we can move on to hacking which should be fun. Which I hope we will learn a bunch and just have a strong understand of the internet itself. For this we are going to need to really learn some script lanuage and just how to look for bugs.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of this it seems like a lot but i honstly feel like it will be done within the year. I also want to build some projects on top of this that we can use and some projects on the crypto space too that we will be able to use too. At the same time potential our own better cooler blockchain.
      </p>

      <p>
        So yeah seems like a lot but everything will get done, I will be creating a little note book as well as blog posts and youtube videos to follow up on certain courses, as well as maybe just doing a daily live stream on how things are going. Maybe a learning stream or a building stream. Just just thinking about how all of this is going to be set up. But just want to be able to set this website up, set up my blog website. And the discord and telegram and youtube just to get situated with the communication between us and the other aspects as well.
