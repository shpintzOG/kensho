				<h2>Its been a while for sure</h2>
				<p>Hopefully you guys have missed me as much as I did and I would like
				for us to get things slowly going like before. I know i wasn't that good
				but I am kinda of better but would like you guys to help out in the proc
				ess. Just hope you guys are ready to have some fun and do something fun
				and hopefully cool too.</p>

				<h2>Something to look forward to</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>Coding</li>
					<li>Crypto</li>
					<li>Hacking</li>

				</ul>

				<p>
				 Its a little bit but will make sense once all together, this isn't just all of it but just a little, eventually
				 there will be more in the future. Mean time feel like these are the best to focus on at the moment to then tranisition
				 into something bigger and or better.
				</p> 
				
				<p>
				 You guys will have  a little profile for yourself to kinda of check out your status etc. At the same time just be able					to see what I have wrote about you in a way. Hopefully there will be more but for now I am just going to stick simple.				       Also forgot to mention eventually there will be more like blogs and videos about how to get through at the same time				      the websites that I built etc.
