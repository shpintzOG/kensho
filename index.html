				<h2>Its been a while for sure</h2>
				<p>Hopefully you guys have missed me as much as I did and I would like
				for us to get things slowly going like before. I know i wasn't that good
				but I am kinda of better but would like you guys to help out in the proc
				ess. Just hope you guys are ready to have some fun and do something fun
				and hopefully cool too.</p>

					<h2>Something to look forward to</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>Coding</li>
						<li>Crypto</li>
						<li>Hacking</li>

					</ul>

				<p>
				 Its a little bit but will make sense once all together, this isn't just all of it but just a little, eventually
				 there will be more in the future. Mean time feel like these are the best to focus on at the moment to then tranisition into something bigger and or better.
				</p>

				<p>
				 You guys will have  a little profile for yourself to kinda of check out your status etc. At the same time just be able	to see what I have wrote about you in a way. Hopefully there will be more but for now I am just going to stick simple. Also forgot to mention eventually there will be more like blogs and videos about how to get through at the same time the websites that I built etc.

				<h2>Group Section</h2>

				<p>
					Yes I want us to become a group again, this is going to be something cool basically going to set up a little NFT minting site which will be launched soon. Where we will need that NFT in order to access the site. The site will be intergrated with web3 (blockchain) so then we can make some crypto moves as a team. At the same time access other protcols soon too like defi. And basically create something cool like a profile which I will show you what I am talking, but would like to know if you are down. I have made some preview of mine as well as some friends to show tribute too.
